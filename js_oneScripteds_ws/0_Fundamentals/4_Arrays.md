1. **Mutator Methods (Modify the Original Array):**
   - `push()`: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
   - `pop()`: Removes the last element from the end of an array.
   - `unshift()`: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
   - `shift()`: Removes the first element from the beginning of an array.
   - `splice()`: Changes the contents of an array by adding or removing elements at a specific index.

2. **Accessor Methods (Don't Modify the Original Array, Return New Values or Information):**
   - `concat()`: Combines two or more arrays and returns a new array.
   - `join()`: Joins all elements of an array into a string.
   - `slice()`: Extracts a portion of an array and returns a new array.
   - `indexOf()`: Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array.
   - `lastIndexOf()`: Returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array.
   - `includes()`: Checks if an array contains a certain element and returns a boolean.
   - `every()`: Tests whether all elements in the array pass a provided function's test.
   - `some()`: Tests whether at least one element in the array passes a provided function's test.
   - `filter()`: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the provided function's test.
   - `map()`: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.
   - `reduce()`: Applies a function to an accumulator and each element, reducing the array to a single value.
   - `reduceRight()`: Similar to `reduce()`, but starts from the end of the array.

3. **Iteration Methods (Execute a Function for Each Element of the Array):**
   - `forEach()`: Calls a provided function once for each element in the array.
   - `entries()`: Returns an iterator object with key-value pairs for each element and its index.
   - `keys()`: Returns an iterator object containing the keys (indices) of the array.
   - `values()`: Returns an iterator object containing the values of the array.

4. **Transformation Methods (Create a New Array with Modified Elements):**
   - `flatMap()`: Maps each element using a mapping function, then flattens the result into a new array.
   - `from()`: Creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object.
   - `of()`: Creates a new array from individual arguments passed to the method.

5. **Searching and Sorting Methods:**
   - `find()`: Returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.
   - `findIndex()`: Returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.
   - `sort()`: Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.
   - `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the elements in an array.
