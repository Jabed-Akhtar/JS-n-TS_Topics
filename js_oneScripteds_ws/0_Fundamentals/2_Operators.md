### Arithmetic Operators
- `+`: Addition
- `-`: Subtraction
- `*`: Multiplication
- `/`: Division
- `%`: Modulus (remainder)
- `**`: Exponentiation (ES6)

### Assignment Operators
- `=`: Assignment
- `+=`: Addition assignment
- `-=`: Subtraction assignment
- `*=`: Multiplication assignment
- `/=`: Division assignment
- `%=`: Modulus assignment
- `**=`: Exponentiation assignment (ES6)

### Comparison Operators
- `==`: Equal to
- `===`: Strict equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `!==`: Strict not equal to
- `>`: Greater than
- `<`: Less than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
- `<=`: Less than or equal to

### Logical Operators
- `&&`: Logical AND
- `||`: Logical OR
- `!`: Logical NOT

### Unary Operators
- `+`: Unary plus (converts its operand to a number)
- `-`: Unary minus (negates its operand)
- `++`: Increment
- `--`: Decrement
- `typeof`: Returns a string indicating the type of the operand
- `!`: Logical NOT (also used as a unary operator)

### Bitwise Operators
- `&`: Bitwise AND
- `|`: Bitwise OR
- `^`: Bitwise XOR
- `~`: Bitwise NOT
- `<<`: Left shift
- `>>`: Right shift
- `>>>`: Unsigned right shift

### Conditional (Ternary) Operator
- `condition ? expr1 : expr2`: If the condition is true, `expr1` is returned; otherwise, `expr2` is returned.

### Type Operators
- `instanceof`: Returns true if an object is an instance of a particular class/constructor.
- `typeof`: Returns a string indicating the type of a value.

### String Operators
- `+`: Concatenation (also used for arithmetic addition)
- `+=`: Concatenation assignment

### Miscellaneous Operators
- `,`: Comma operator (evaluates each operand and returns the value of the last operand)
